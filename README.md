## Development

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open <http://localhost:3000> to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Will create an optimised build inside the `build` folder.

This is the command that netlify will run every time `master` is updated.

### `yarn test`

This will run the tests in the project.

I aim at adding some integration tests to it, but didn't have time to yet, feel free to contribute :)~
